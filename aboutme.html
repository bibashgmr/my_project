    <center><h1>About Me</h1></center>
    <dt>Overview</dt>
    <dd>I am Bibash. Certainly! As an IT student, **I'm** not just a collection of ones and zeros; **I'm** a curious explorer navigating the digital universe. **My** days are filled with the rhythmic clatter of keyboard keys, the hum of servers, and the glow of multiple screens. **I'm** the architect of virtual realms, weaving together code, databases, and algorithms. Whether it's debugging a stubborn bug, securing a vulnerable network, or crafting an elegant web application, **I'm** constantly honing **my** skills.<br>
         **My** passion for technology fuels late-night coding sessions and caffeinated brainstorming.<br> Keep pushing boundaries, keep collaborating, and embrace the ever-evolving landscape of IT!</dd>
